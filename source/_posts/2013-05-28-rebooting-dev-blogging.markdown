Development has come a long way in the last 15 years. The scale of things that can be accomplished is amazing. Even more impressive is the rate at which things can be produced.

There's a lot of great resources on the internet, but many of those conflict or are outdated. My goal of this blog is to provide a resource for developers while also tracking progress of some of my side projects.

Much of the work I've done over the last couple years, I haven't been able to talk about. There's many useful techniques that we used that are very general and could be applied to pretty much any situation to make a developer's life much easier.

Ideally, this will be helpful for other developers, but if I'm happy if it becomes a resource for myself.

I'm also hosting this via [a public repo](https://github.com/Ryan-K/ryan-k.github.com) on GitHub pages and welcome any comments or contributions.
